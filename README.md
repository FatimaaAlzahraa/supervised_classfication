# supervised_classfication
Classification is a supervised machine learning method that predicts the correct label of a given input data

we use titanic dataset in this project 
1- first clean the null values in columns and drop column have more then 50% null values 
2- then use hotencoding to convert string to numbering 
3- finally use multiply classfication models to treining in data and show accurcy ,f1-score 
4- use Grid search is a technique used in machine learning to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a given model
5- Cross-validation is a resampling technique used in machine learning to assess the performance of a model on unseen data and to tune its hyperparameters
